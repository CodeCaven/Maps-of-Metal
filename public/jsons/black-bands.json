With this change, he also adopted the new stage name \"Sin Nanna\".\nFrom 1997 the Striborg sound solidified around a singular lo-fi black metal style combined with ambient pieces, with all instruments and vocals primarily recorded by Menzies at his home. Releases were prodigious - often two or more per year. Formal releases were initially on the Asguard and Finsternis labels, moving to Displeased and Southern Lord Records as international recognition grew.In 2018 Striborg moved away from black metal with the release of Blackwave, a full-length LP in a dark ambient/new wave style.

Soon after the release of this demo Phillip died in a car crash and not long after, Stefan committed suicide. However painful this episode was to the band, they decided to continue and Stefan's position was taken by his drum roadie Walter van Cortenberg.\nAs Johan then decided to leave the music scene, the band found replacements for both him and Phillip in guitar players Pascal and Bart Vandereycken. This line-up would go on to release the Evil Prevails EP and several others through various record labels. Pascal was eventually fired for lack of dedication due to his obligations to the Belgian Navy, which reduced the band to a trio. In 1994 their first full-length album was released entitled The Diabolic Serenades. This line-up would also record the band's second album Blasfemia Eternal before in May 1996, just after its release, Bart left the band.Flemish and non-Flemish musicians stepped in to help out the band on several tours in support of the album, which eventually led the once strongly Flemish rooted band to become an international act with the addition of Dutch guitar player Erik Sprooten (ex-Inquisitor) later that same year and Finnish guitar player Jan \"\u00d6rkki\" Yrlund (ex-Lacrimosa) in mid-1997. Shortly after the release of their third album Fatherland a keyboard player was found in Domingo Smets (ex-Agathocles). This line-up would record Dim Carcosa, before Smets left the band in 2002 and a replacement was found in Davy Wouters (ex-Oblivion, Danse Macabre). This line-up can be seen on the live album/DVD And the Hordes Stood as One.\nWhile on tour in support of the live album in May 2003, the band fired guitar player Jan Yrlund and brought back Bart in his stead. In December 2004, the line-up was further extended with the return of former members Domingo Smets, who took over as bass player since G\u00fcnther wanted to focus on singing, and Raf Jansen\u2014who had filled Bart's position for several months in 1996-1997\u2014as third guitar player.

They were signed to Spikefarm Records for the majority of their releases and disbanded in 2006, but reformed again in 2015 with a partially different line-up.\nThyrane was formed by Blastmor in 1994 when he and two other musicians began playing together. After going through several line-up changes, Blastmor found guitarist Daemon and bass guitar player R. Gr\u00f6nholm in 1996. In 1997, a second guitarist, Avather, joined the band. They  recorded their \"Black Harmony\" demo in Tico-Tico Studio. Woodcut Records were interested. Thyrane's first full-length album, Symphones Of Infernality, was released in 1999. R Gr\u00f6nholm left because of personal reasons, forcing Daemon to play bass guitar, and Blastmor to play lead guitar as well as the vocals. One year later, Spikefarm Records signed Thyrane and they recorded their second full-length album The Spirit Of Rebellion.\nThe Spirit Of Rebellion received very positive reviews. Spikefarm Records then re-released \"Black Harmony\" in conjunction with The Dead Beginners' MCD. After the release, Thyrane toured France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Croatia, Austria, Switzerland and Hungary with Ancient and Stormlord.\nHypnotic was released in 2003. The band took a different turn with this album. Instead of playing the speedy, aggressive black metal packed full of double-kick drumming, they moved briefly into the industrial metal circle. With their last CD, Travesty of Heavenly Essence, they returned to their previous style with just a slight industrial metal influence.\nOn 28th of Januari 2022, Thyrane announced they are working on a new album and shared live footage of their Steelchaos 2020 show on their facebook page. \n\"Hark! Several people have asked us when it's time for a new Thyrane album. Rest assured, we are equally eager to release it as soon it's finished.

Over the course of its career, Kekal has transitioned from a heavy metal-based style to a more experimental and electronic sound.\nThroughout its entire career, the band has released thirteen full-length studio albums, four EPs, several compilations and contributions to various collaborative albums, and in 2004 engaged in a successful European mini-tour.

They formed in 1997 in the town of Rimini (Romagna). After the release of their self-produced debut The Melting Idols, they began an active live streak with bands like Lacuna Coil, Ancient, and Napalm Death. Upon opening for the cult Norwegian black metal band Ancient in Padova (Italy), the band developed a friendship with their drummer Grom, who soon after joined the band out of admiration for their work and made it his primary side-project. At this point, the band began the recording process of their second album and first official release Waltzing Mephisto which had been years in the writing. The album was recorded at the well-known Italian metal studio Fear. Following the recording, the band signed a deal with Greek label Black Lotus Records in October 2002 and subsequently with Sleaszy Rider Records (EMI) for their 3rd and most evolved concept album The Blow Of Furious Winds in May 2005.\nImmediately following their 1998 demo cassette 'An Abode For Spirit And Flesh', they quickly developed a wide and strong following in the underground and gained attention from the specialized press with few reviews hitting lower than the 'excellent' mark.\nThe band has since achieved cult status within the extreme metal underground, partly due to their secretive live appearances, but mainly due to their unique and eclectic blend of styles & cover songs. Their music drew from 1970s progressive rock, gothic, classical and ambient... All blended with their original form of death/black metal. They incorporated instruments such as piano, viola, violin, mandolin, synth, and very diverse vocal styles into their music. This was rare and uncommon during those years. Drummer GROM's following with his other notable acts (Doomsword, Ancient...) is most likely another reason.\nHortus Animae is well-known within the genre for its unique and eclectic cover songs. The official debut Waltzing Mephisto contained a cover of the black metal anthem \"Freezing Moon\" (Mayhem) blended with Mike Oldfield's \"Tubular Bells (The Exorcist)\" and Italian 1970s prog band Il Balletto Di Bronzo's \"Terzo Incontro\", highlighting the band's inspiration with 1970s dark progressive rock music. This song is still considered to this day as one of the most appreciated covers in the extreme metal underground. Their following epic album The Blow Of Furious Winds contained yet another 1970s prog rock cover. A diverse and original mold of Queen's \"The Fairy Feller's Masterstroke\" & \"Nevermore\".\nIn between the 2 albums, the band appeared with another 'now cult' cover song on the Black Lotus Records' release The Lotus Eaters: Tribute to Dead Can Dance. Hortus Animae recorded their metalized epic interpretation of \"Windfall\" & \"Summoning Of The Muse\" featuring a joint effort with gothic singer Liv Kristine (Theatre Of Tragedy, Leave's Eyes, Atrocity) on lead vocals.\nHortus Animae has been proclaimed 'best emerging band' and 'best Italian album of the year' in the polls of the top Italian magazine Metal Maniac in 2005.\nThe group disbanded on 18 January 2006.\nThey posted this message on their homepage of their website:\n\"Due to different motivations the band decided to split-up or, at least, to stay on-hold for some time. There are technical and personal reasons involved (the music business, hardships... life itself) which led us to take this decision. We faced many difficulties in the music industry, but we wish to thank and hail all the fans and people who bought our albums, visited our websites, came to our shows, wrote to us, believed in what we did or just listened to our music. We also want to thank the worldwide metal press for their support. We may return in the future, but for now we just don't know.\"\nYears after their split they released a 10th-anniversary commemorative boxset (sold out) called 'Funeral Nation: 10 years of Hortus Animae' through Sleaszy Rider Records (EMI distribution). The boxset contained various gadgets (T-shirt, mug, pin, etc.) as well as their first 2 official albums Waltzing Mephisto (in an unreleased demo version) & The Blow Of Furious Winds, and a 'Making of...'

However, following discord with the label, Rygg formed his own imprint, Jester Records, in 1998.In 1997, Rygg invited composer and multi-instrumentalist Tore Ylwizaker into the band, and together they changed Ulver's musical direction. Their first musical endeavour together, Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, drew from a variety of non-metal sources, including classical and avant-garde, and the works of William Blake.

After a few initial releases (In Flames of Black Arts, Oniriad and the MCD In the Opium of Black Veil), the founding member Flauros (vocals) managed to gather musicians who have since been identified as the band's core: guitar players Chris and Daamr, female vocalist Nera and keyboard player Spectre. The album Semidevilish, released in 2004, established the sound of the newly consolidated band and gave it strength to start appearing more regularly on stage.\nThe following year saw the release of Transkarpatia. The album, produced by Andy LaRocque, the guitar force behind King Diamond. As a result, Darzamat started to be feature in such European festivals as Rock Hard Open, Wave Gothic Treffen, Hard Rock Laager, S-Hammer Festival, Last Night on Earth, Dong Open Festival, Moscow After Midnight and Metal Head Mission. At that time, the band found themselves performing for an ever widening circle of audiences in Balkan states, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belgium, Holland, Italy, France and Germany. Also around that time Darzamat embarked on tours supporting Sabaton in Benelux countries and Moonspell in Poland.\nThe year 2007 saw the band perform on Winternachtstraum Festival and on the 21st edition of the Polish Metalmania Festival, organized since the 1980s. This performance was documented on the DVD album Live Profanity (Visiting the Graves of the Heretics), released internationally.\nIn the 2009 Darzamat landed a worldwide record deal with Massacre Records, a German label, and delivered their fifth album, Solfernus\u2019 Path, also made available in Japan. Solfernus\u2019 Path marked the first time the band ever ventured into a concept album territory. Andy LaRocque moved from the production seat to the guest-musician spot and contributed a solo on \u2018The King of the Burning Anthems\u2019. The song, along with two other ones\u2014'Pain Collector\u2019 and \u2018Chimera\u2019\u2014was selected to promote the album and all three were made into videos. Darzamat toured in Poland, Mexico, France, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Belgium, then returned to Poland to make an appearance at the Castle Party Festival.\nIn 2011 the band took a long break. Nera used her time away to focus on her solo project, NeraNature, which features gentler, atmospheric rock laced with electronics. She delivered three albums, with the latest one, MagJa, released in 2018. Flauros, on the other hand, decided to bring back the black metal act Mastiphal. In 2011 Parvzya (Witching Hour) was released, the first new full-length since the 1995 debut For a Glory of All Evil Spirits...\nIn 2019 Darzamat announced a new album The Burning Kingdom. The fans can expect another concept album, picking up the story right where its predecessor left off. Flauros, the main creative force behind the work, has revealed that this chapter takes place in London and that the lyrics for the album were penned by him and a long-time friend and writer, Jesion Kowal. Musically, the album opens a new era in Darzamat's history: gone are the keyboards, up till now characteristically prominent. In their place the band inserts more diversified and complex guitar sounds. Pre-production and recording sessions for The Burning Kingdom were overseen by Maurycy \u2018Mauser\u2019 Stefanowicz of Vader fame; production and mixing were handled by Polish producer, Jaros\u0142aw Baran.
